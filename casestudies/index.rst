     NuMaps is an Australian based startup company that publishes Australian
     Bureau Statistics (ABS) Census data as DemographicDrapes(TM) which are
     simply semi-transparent thematic map overlays.  NuMaps initially
     considered using the Google Maps API but preferred to use OpenLayers as it
     supported access to any number of different base map suppliers and it
     provided a robust interface to OGC published services.
