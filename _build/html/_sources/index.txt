What is OpenLayers?
===================

OpenLayers is a pure JavaScript library for displaying map data in most
modern web browsers, with no server-side dependencies. OpenLayers implements a
`JavaScript API`_ for building rich web-based geographic applications, similar
to the Google Maps and MSN Virtual Earth APIs, with one important difference --
OpenLayers is Free Software, developed for and by the Open Source software
community.

One of the guiding principles of OpenLayers development has been to maintain
a set of small examples of most functionality, allowing the library to 
demonstrate most of what it can do by example. This means that our examples
are typically our most up to date source of documentation, and provide more
than 100 different code snippets for use in your applications. 

These examples are available from the `OpenLayers Examples`_ page.
